## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.
